# ASSESSMENT 4: INTRO TO RUBY
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own there is always something more to learn.   

1. In what ways are JavaScript and Ruby similar? In what ways are they different?

  Your answer: The similarities between JavaScript & Ruby are: they are both scripting languages and they both are object oriented 
  that can be used to make interactive functionality within programming/for user experience. JavaScript is primarly frontend while Ruby 
  is also used for the backend. 

  Researched answer:
  JavaScript and Ruby are object-oriented, dynamic and general purpose scripting language which is interpreted rather than compile 
  during runtime. JavaScript can be used as front-end and back-end language using the same language whereas Ruby is used as
  back-end programming language.

 -- i was wrong in ruby being frontend at times. 

2. What is a hash?

  Your answer: has is a { } in a class that contains many instance variables holding data

  Researched answer:
  Unlike arrays which are mere lists, Hashes are like dictionaries:

You can use them to look up one thing by another thing. We say: we look up a value from a Hash using a key. Or one could say: Please get me the value that is associated with this key.

Imagine a real dictionary that translates from English to German. When you look up the English word “hello” 
then you’ll find the German “Hallo”. When you look up “one” then you’ll find “eins”, and so on.



3. What is the testing framework used in Ruby? Describe the process of setting up the testing environment.

  Your answer: you set up a rspec file ex car.rb and a car_spec.rb file at the top of the file you put require 'rspec'
  and require_relative 'car' cd into the rspec file then into the rspec file and in terminal run gem install or so 

  Researched answer:
    a lot to copy. I think I missed irb in terminal 


4. Name three possible relationships between objects?

  Your answer: Class can contain functions/methods and methods can contain 
  variables that contain info. 

  Researched answer:
  Object oriented programming generally support 4 types of relationships that are: inheritance ,association, composition
  and aggregation. All these relationship is based on "is a" relationship, "has-a" relationship and "part-of" relationship.
  In this article we will understand all these relationships



5. What is an instance variable? How is it different from other variables in Ruby?

  Your answer: instance variables contain values that are in relation of a cetrain scope to a specific class. 

  Researched answer: An instance variable has a name beginning with @ , and its scope is confined to whatever object
  self refers to. ... Instance variables of ruby do not need declaration. This implies a
  flexible structure of objects. In fact, each instance variable is dynamically appended to an object when it is first referenced.



6. Ruby has a great community and tons of free resources to help you learn. [Here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/)is a list of great resources. Below are a few popular ones:
- [Interactive Ruby Tutorial](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- [Why's (poigniant) Guide to Ruby](http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html): comics, anecdotes, and microscopic canaries
- [Ruby in 20 Min](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
- [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)

Choose one of these resources and look through the material for 10-15 min. List three new things you learned about Ruby:

1) Good styling is essential. More code is read than written, make sure to be consistent!

2) Good code practice in one language might be bad in another.

3) Revision is key.
